# # # Let's suppose we have a for loop like this

# # list = ["Mango" , "banana" , "Apple" , "Grapes"]

# # for numbers in list:
# #   print(numbers)
# # Now let's suppose we are going to print out numbers from 1 to 100 . For this purpose we will use the functionality and the feature of range in for loop

# for i in range(101): # This is the way to print numbers till a desired number

#   print(i)
